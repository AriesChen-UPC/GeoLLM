# GeoLLM
**Large Language Model for Geology**
Large language models are used to organize geology-related knowledge (geology, geophysics, geophysical logging, etc.). This version uses the ChatGLM-6B base model and fine-tunes it using P-tuning.

### Sedimentology

Sedimentology, the study of sedimentary rocks and the processes by which they are formed, includes and is related to a large number of phenomena. Sedimentology includes the five fundamental processes defined by the term sediaentation --weathering, erosion, transportation, deposition and diagenesis.

1. [ChatGLM-6B](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B/tree/main):ChatGLM-6B is an open bilingual language model based on General Language Model (GLM) framework, with 6.2 billion parameters. With the quantization technique, users can deploy locally on consumer-grade graphics cards (only 6GB of GPU memory is required at the INT4 quantization level).
